Thanks for checking out Oslyn Tabs! This is a tool that was inspired by the humble PowerPoint. 
Instead of chord sheets on a single page, this app intelligently spreads it across multiple slides.

We might use AI to turn the page for you ðŸ˜‰, stay tuned!

Before we begin, lets work on some terminology:

## Song

This is a chord sheet and its metadata (think artist, song title, album, original song key, etc. ). This is the building block for us to create set lists.

## Set List

A set list is a collection of songs, arranged in a particular order. A set list contains a short description you could use to describe *why* you chose to put these songs together in a set list.

Modification of a song referenced by a set list would also change the set list.

Example: if Song A was a part of Set List B and C. If you change the chords / lyrics on Song A, Set List B and C would also change.

## Jam Session
