## Why?

I love how music brings people together. Most chord sheet apps focus on individuals, but I wanted something different. This app lets people join jam sessions and sync their chord sheets. It doesn't matter if someone is not very familiar with a song; they can still participate. Music is all about connecting, and that's what I wanted to encourage with this app.
